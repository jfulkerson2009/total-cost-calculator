# Tax and Total Calculator

## This program will allow the user to input a base purchase price (or subtotal). The program will use the base purchase price to determine the state tax, couty tax, and add them together to calculate the total purchase price. Once the prices have been determined it will display each price individually to the user.

#### This was the first project I created in my SDEV140 course, which centered around Python programming. Since we had only just begun the course this project doesn't use any data validation or anything fancy.

#### If you have any feedback or questions please let me know!
